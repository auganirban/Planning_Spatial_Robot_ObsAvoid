# Planning_Spatial_Robot_ObsAvoid
Open the MATLAB environment and simply run the script named `dir2goal_window_w_box.m`.

After running the above script, you should see the cylinder model of the Baxter robot which is holding a blue colored box at its end-effector. The planner successfully avoids the obstacle wall and brings the box to the other side of the wall by passing it through a small window opening inside the wall.
